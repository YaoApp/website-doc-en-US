Why open source?

After YAO is open source, answering these questions has become our daily work.

## The meaning of open source

In the introduction of YAO, it was mentioned that the original intention of creating YAO was to create a tool that could help developers to free themselves from repetitive and uninteresting work and have more energy to think and create more interesting works.

Our only hope is that YAO can bring value to more people and more people use it.

**Open source is not a marketing tool, it is collaboration, communication, and sharing. **

We learn technology from excellent open source projects and capture inspiration; in the communication with expert, we get inspiration and improve ourselves. The accumulation of these bits and pieces will eventually become code applied to YAO to make it better.

YAO also shares our thinking and our practical results with you through open source. These practical experiences or codes can also be applied to your projects to make your projects better.

## Open source collaboration

Linux, its presence everywhere.

Linux is also the most successful collaboration case in human history. The ability to allow tens of thousands of developers to work in an orderly manner and create tens of millions of lines of code is the power of open source collaboration.

With the maturity of network environment, VR/AR and other technologies, in some specific fields, the way of people-to-people collaboration is also quietly changing, and we believe that telecommuting will also become the mainstream.

Because of COVID-19, we have tried to work purely remotely. With the support of various collaborative tools, we were surprised to find that remote working did not reduce work efficiency, but improved a lot.

These practical experiences also lead us to think, is it possible for a group of strangers to jointly create valuable projects through open source collaboration? Everyone can do what they like, and participants can make money through the project and get benefits?

We need to gradually practice and implement them, and will continue to explore and find the best landing path.
