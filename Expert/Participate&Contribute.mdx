> Open source has become a "trend of the times". If a project is not open source, you are embarrassed to say hello to others.

Why open source? Open source how do you make money? Are you just "getting hot"?

After YAO is open source, answering these questions has become our daily work.

## The meaning of open source

In the introduction of YAO, it was mentioned that the original intention of creating YAO was to create a tool that could help developers to free themselves from repetitive and uninteresting work and bid farewell to them.
996, have more energy to think and create more interesting works.

Because of this, YAO has no KPI/OKR, and the number of Stars has no meaning for YAO. Our only hope is that YAO can bring value to more people and more people use it.

**Open source is not a marketing tool. The significance of open source lies in collaboration, communication and sharing. **

We learn technology from excellent open source projects and capture inspiration; in the communication with Daniel, we get inspiration and improve ourselves. The accumulation of these bits and pieces will eventually become code applied to YAO to make it better.

YAO also shares our thinking and our practical results with you through open source. These practical experiences or codes can also be applied to your projects to make your projects better.

## Open source collaboration

Linux, as long as humans can reach, almost has its presence.

The birth and development of Linux is also the most successful collaboration case in human history. The ability to allow tens of thousands of developers to work in an orderly manner and create tens of millions of lines of code is the power of open source collaboration.

With the maturity of network environment, VR/AR and other technologies, in some specific fields, the way of people-to-people collaboration is also quietly changing, and we believe that telecommuting will also become the mainstream.

Since the new crown epidemic, we have tried to work purely remotely. With the support of various collaborative tools, we were surprised to find that remote working did not reduce work efficiency, but improved a lot.

These practical experiences also lead us to think, is it possible for a group of strangers to jointly create valuable projects through open source collaboration? Everyone can do what they like, and participants can make money through the project and get benefits?

The invention of the company can also be seen as a revolution in the way of human collaboration, which unleashes enormous productivity. So in the future, will there be an organizational form beyond the "company" that can create value more efficiently, obtain benefits, and share these benefits relatively fairly?

Of course, these seem to be too ideal now, and we need to gradually practice and implement them. We will continue to explore and find the best landing path.
