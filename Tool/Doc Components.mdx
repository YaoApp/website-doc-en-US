# Doc Components

It mainly shows which components are supported by the document.

## Headings

headings will be parsed into a file title tree and displayed in the right anchor navigation bar. Currently H1-H6 is supported, where H1-H4 represent normal levels, that is, the heading size is larger than the text, H5, H6 represent abnormal levels, and H1 is usually the document Title, H2 is the section title (the top margin of H2 will be larger than the others), which are expressed as different levels of titles in turn.
