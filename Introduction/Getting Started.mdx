YAO is an open-source application engine, written in Golang, in the form of a command-line tool that can be downloaded and used immediately. It is suitable for developing business systems, website/APP API, admin panel, self-built low-code platforms, etc.

YAO adopts a flow-based programming model to implement various functions by writing YAO DSL (Logical Description in JSON format) or using JavaScript to write processes. The YAO DSL can be written in several ways:

1. Purely hand-written

2. Use automated scripts to generate contextual logic

3. Use the visual editor to create by "drag and drop"

Yao's name is derived from the Chinese character **yao (yáo)**, the basic symbol that makes up the Eight Trigrams. The gossip is a symbol system created by the ancient god Fuxi after observing and summarizing the laws of nature, which can refer to everything. Yao has two states of yin and yang, like 0 and 1. The transformation of yin and yang of Yao drives the replacement of gossip, so as to summarize and record the development law of things.

## Getting started

<Notice type="warning">
  Note: You need to understand JSON, RESTFul before starting Basic concepts and
  common sense of APIs, relational databases, and common terminal commands. To
  handle very complex business logic, you need to master the JavaScript
  language.

### Preparation: Install Yao

Run the script under terminal: (MacOS/Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://website.yaoapps.com/install.sh | bash
```

For Windows users, please refer to the Installation and Debugging chapter:

<Extend
  title="Installation and debugging"
  desc="Learn how to create a Yao development and debugging environment locally"
  link="Introduction/Installation and debugging"
></Extend>

### Step 1: Create a project

Create a new project directory, enter the project directory, and run the `yao init` command to create a blank Yao application.

```bash
mkdir -p /data/crm # create project directory
cd /data/crm # Enter the project directory
yao init # run the initializer
```

After the command runs successfully, the `app.json file` , `db`, `ui` , `data` and other directories will be created

```bash
├── data # Used to store files generated by the application, such as pictures, PDFs, etc.
├── db # Used to store SQLite database files
│ └── yao.db
└── ui # The static file server file directory, where custom front-end products can be placed. The files in this directory can be accessed through http://host:port/filename .
└── app.json # Application configuration file, used to define the application name, etc.
```

### Step 2: Create the data table

Use the `yao migrate` command to create the data table, open the command line terminal, **run in the project root directory**:

```bash
yao migrate
```

initialization menu

```bash
yao run flows.setmenu
```

### Step 3: Start the service

Open a command line terminal, **run in the project root directory**:

```bash
yao start
```

1. Open a browser, visit `https://127.0.0.1:5099/xiang/login/admin`,

2. Enter the default username: `xiang@iqka.com`, password: `A123456p+`
