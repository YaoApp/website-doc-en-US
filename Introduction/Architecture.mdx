# YAO schema analysis

![Architecture diagram](https://release-sv-1252011659.cos.na-siliconvalley.myqcloud.com/docs/%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D/architecture.png)

Based on the flow-based programming idea, YAO encapsulates a series of atomic operations into processes; these processes can be called in YAO DSL or JavaScript scripts.

According to business characteristics, YAO defines a set of YAO DSL to describe functional modules such as data structure, data flow, API interface, concurrent tasks, scheduled tasks, and Socket services. These functional modules are defined as Widgets.

When the engine starts, it is parsed into a set of API interfaces and a set of handlers according to the Widget logic. In application development, by writing a Widget DSL to describe the differences, the corresponding functional modules can be implemented, thereby improving coding efficiency.

YAO DSL and YAO Widget support the definition of extensions according to their own business characteristics, which makes it easier to build a low-code platform based on YAO that meets their own business characteristics.

## add handler

For some specific scenarios, you need to add a new process to the engine, use the `gou.RegisterProcessHandler` method to register a Golang function as a process.

It is recommended to set a specific namespace to prevent conflicts, so that it can be merged with the latest YAO code at any time.

add a handler file

```bash
mkdir -p /code/root/yao/myprocesses
touch /code/root/yao/myprocesses/hello.go
touch /code/root/yao/myprocesses/hello_test.go
```

### process logic

`/code/root/yao/myprocesses/hello.go`

```go
package myprocesses

import(
    "github.com/yaoapp/gou"
)

func init() {
gou.RegisterProcessHandler("mycom.myprocesses.hello", processHello) // register the process
}

// processHello processing logic
func processHello(process *gou.Process) interface{} {
args := process.Args
return map[string]interface{}{"args": process.Args}
}
```

referenced in the main program

Edit `/code/root/yao/main.go`

```go

package main

import (
"github.com/yaoapp/yao/cmd"

_ "github.com/yaoapp/gou/encoding"
_ "github.com/yaoapp/yao/crypto"
_ "github.com/yaoapp/yao/helper"
_ "github.com/yaoapp/yao/network"
_ "github.com/yaoapp/yao/system"
_ "github.com/yaoapp/yao/user"
_ "github.com/yaoapp/yao/xfs"
    _ "github.com/yaoapp/yao/myprocesses"
)

// main program
func main() {
cmd.Execute()
}

```

### unit test

`/code/root/yao/myprocesses/hello_test.go`

```go
package myprocesses

import (
"testing"
"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
"github.com/yaoapp/gou"
)

func TestProcessHello(t *testing.T) {
args := []interface{}{"hello world", "foo", "bar", 0.618}
res, err := gou.NewProcess("mycom.myprocesses.hello", args...).Exec()
if err != nil {
t. Fatal(err)
}
assert. Equal(t, []interface{}{"hello world", "foo", "bar", 0.618}, res.(map[string]interface{})["args"])
}

```

run the test

```bash
cd /code/root/yao/myprocesses
go test -run TestProcessHello
```

### Calling the example in the application

#### Use in data flow

Add dataflow file

```bash
mkdir -p /code/root/yao/tests/flows/mycom
touch /code/root/yao/tests/flows/mycom/hello.flow.json
```

Write logic `/code/root/yao/tests/flows/mycom/hello.flow.json`

```json
{
  "label": "Hello",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Hello",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "hello",
      "process": "mycom.myprocesses.hello",
      "args": ["hello world", "foo", "bar", 0.618]
    }
  ],
  "output": "{{$res.args}}"
}
```

run the test

```bash
cd /code/root/yao/
go run . run flows.mycom.hello
```

#### Use in JavaScript scripts

add script file

```bash
mkdir -p /code/root/yao/tests/scripts/mycom
touch /code/root/yao/tests/scripts/mycom/hello.js
```

write script `/code/root/yao/tests/scripts/mycom/hello.js`

```javascript
function Hi() {
  return Process("mycom.myprocesses.hello", "hello world", "foo", "bar", 0.618);
}
```

run the test

```bash
cd /code/root/yao/
go run . run scripts.mycom.hello.Hi
```
