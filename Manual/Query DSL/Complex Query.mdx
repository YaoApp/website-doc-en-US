# Aggregate query

## Data aggregation `groups`, `havings`

The data aggregation method is defined in `groups`, and the Group data structure is `Array<Object Group>`.

| Fields  | Type                   | Description                                    | Required Fields |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| groups  | Array\<Object Group\>  | Aggregate fields and statistics level settings | No              |
| havings | Array\<Object Having\> | Aggregate query result filtering               | No              |

**Object Group data structure**

| Fields  | Type             | Description                                                                                                        | Required Fields |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| field   | Field Expression | field expression, aliasing is not supported `as`                                                                   | yes             |
| rollup  | String           | Returns multi-level statistical results at the same time, corresponding to the name of the aggregated field value. | No              |
| comment | String           | Aggregate condition comment to help understand query condition logic and render in development platform.           | No              |

### data sheet

Data table `service` :

| id  | city     | kind          | amount |
| --- | -------- | ------------- | ------ |
| 1   | Beijing  | Cloud Hosting | 50     |
| 2   | Beijing  | Cloud Hosting | 50     |
| 3   | Beijing  | Cloud Storage | 50     |
| 4   | Shanghai | Cloud Hosting | 200    |

## Aggregate statistics `group`

Gou Query DSL:

```json
{
  "select": ["kind as type", "city as city", ":SUM(amount) as quantity"],
  "from": "service",
  "groups": [
    { "field": "kind", "comment": "Statistics by type" },
    { "field": "city", "comment": "Statistics by city" }
  ]
}
```

The parsed `SQL statement` is (MySQL):

```sql
  SELECT
    `kind` AS `type`,
    `city` AS `city`,
    SUM(`amount`) AS `amount`
  FROM `service`
  GROUP BY `kind`, `city`
```

The query result is:

| Type          | City     | Quantity |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cloud Hosting | Beijing  | 100      |
| Cloud Storage | Beijing  | 50       |
| Cloud Hosting | Shanghai | 200      |

## Multi-level aggregation statistics `rollup`

Gou Query DSL:

```json
{
  "select": ["kind as type", "city as city", ":SUM(amount) as quantity"],
  "from": "service",
  "groups": [
    { "field": "kind", "rollup": "all types", "comment": "statistics by type" },
    { "field": "city", "comment": "Statistics by city" }
  ]
}
```

The parsed `SQL statement` is (MySQL):

```sql
  SELECT
    IF(GROUPING(`kind`), 'all types', `kind`) AS `type`,
    `city` AS `city`,
    SUM(`amount`) AS `amount`
  FROM `service`
  GROUP BY `kind`, `city` WITH ROLLUP
```

The query result is:

| Type          | City     | Quantity |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cloud Hosting | Shanghai | 200      |
| Cloud Hosting | Beijing  | 100      |
| Cloud Host    | **NULL** | 300      |
| Cloud Storage | Beijing  | 50       |
| Cloud Storage | **NULL** | 50       |
| **all types** | **NULL** | 350      |

Gou Query DSL:

```json
{
  "select": ["kind as type", "city as city", ":SUM(amount) as quantity"],
  "from": "service",
  "groups": [
    { "field": "kind", "rollup": "all types", "comment": "statistics by type" },
    { "field": "city", "rollup": "All cities", "comment": "Statistics by city" }
  ]
}
```

The parsed `SQL statement` is (MySQL):

```sql
  SELECT
    IF(GROUPING(`kind`), 'all types', `kind`) AS `type`,
    IF(GROUPING(`city`), 'all cities', `city`) AS `city`,
    SUM(`amount`) AS `amount`
  FROM `service`
  GROUP BY `kind`, `city` WITH ROLLUP
```

The query result is:

| Type          | City           | Quantity |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Cloud Hosting | Shanghai       | 200      |
| Cloud Hosting | Beijing        | 100      |
| Cloud Hosting | **All Cities** | 300      |
| Cloud Storage | Beijing        | 50       |
| Cloud Storage | **All Cities** | 50       |
| **All Types** | **All Cities** | 350      |

## Aggregate functions `aggregate functions`

Aggregate functions collect statistics on a set of data records according to a specific algorithm and return a value, which is generally used for aggregation queries.

### data sheet

| id  | city     | kind          | amount |
| --- | -------- | ------------- | ------ |
| 1   | Beijing  | Cloud Hosting | 50     |
| 2   | Beijing  | Cloud Hosting | 50     |
| 3   | Beijing  | Cloud Storage | 50     |
| 4   | Shanghai | Cloud Hosting | 200    |

## Aggregate result filtering `havings`

Aggregate result data cannot be filtered in `wheres`. If you need to filter aggregate query results, you can use `havings` to implement, the data structure is `Array<Object Having>`

Gou Query DSL:

```json
{
  "select": ["kind as type", "city as city", ":SUM(amount) as quantity"],
  "from": "service",
  "groups": [
    { "field": "kind", "rollup": "all types", "comment": "statistics by type" },
    { "field": "city", "rollup": "All cities", "comment": "Statistics by city" }
  ],
  "havings": [
    {
      "field": "type",
      "value": "cloud host",
      "comment": "filter cloud host in aggregated results"
    },
    {
      "havings": [
        {
          "field": "quantity",
          "op": "=",
          "value": 100,
          "comment": "quantity equals 100"
        },
        {
          "or": true,
          "field": "number",
          "value": 300,
          "comment": "or 300 records"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The parsed `SQL statement` is (MySQL):

```sql
  SELECT
    IF(GROUPING(`kind`), 'all types', `kind`) AS `type`,
    IF(GROUPING(`city`), 'all cities', `city`) AS `city`,
    SUM(`amount`) AS `amount`
  FROM `service`
  GROUP BY `kind`, `city` WITH ROLLUP
  HAVING `type` = 'cloud host' AND (`quantity` = 100 OR `quantity` = 300)
```

The query result is:

| Type          | City       | Quantity |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Cloud Hosting | Beijing    | 100      |
| Cloud Hosting | All Cities | 300      |

**Object Having Data Structure**

| Fields  | Type                   | Description                                                                                                                             | Required Fields |
| ------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| field   | Field Expression       | field expression, aliasing is not supported `as`                                                                                        | yes             |
| value   | Any                    | Matches numeric values. If the data type is `Field Expression`, use `{}` to include, such as `{updated_at}`                             | no              |
| op      | String                 | Match relational operator. Allowed values ​​`=`,`like`,`in`,`>` etc, default is `=`                                                     | no              |
| or      | Bool                   | `true` The logical relation of the query condition is `or`, the default is `false` The logical relation of the query condition is `and` | No              |
| havings | Array\<Object Having\> | Grouping queries. For `condition 1` `and` ( `condition 2` OR `condition 3`) scenario                                                    | no              |
| query   | Object QueryDSL        | Subquery; `value` value is ignored if `query` is specified. [View Subqueries Documentation](Manual/QueryDSL/Subqueries)                 | No              |
| comment | String                 | The query condition comment, which is used to help understand the query condition logic and render it in the development platform.      | No              |

## Data aggregation syntactic sugar `groups syntactic sugar`

### Groups shorthand

In general, you only need to specify the aggregate field, which can be described by `Array<Field Expression>` structure; or by `Field Expression` type description, and multiple are separated by `,`.

The analysis results described below are the same.

`full description`

```json
{
  "select": ["kind as type", "city as city", ":SUM(amount) as quantity"],
  "from": "service",
  "groups": [
    { "field": "kind", "comment": "Statistics by type" },
    { "field": "city", "comment": "Statistics by city" }
  ]
}
```

`Simplifies to Array<Field Expression>`

```json
{
  "select": ["kind as type", "city as city", ":SUM(amount) as quantity"],
  "from": "service",
  "groups": ["kind", { "field": "city", "comment": "Statistics by city" }]
}
```

`Simplified to Field Expression`

```json
{
  "select": ["kind as type", "city as city", ":SUM(amount) as quantity"],
  "from": "service",
  "groups": "kind,city"
}
```

## JSON Array field aggregation

When performing aggregate query on `JSON Array` field, you need to connect JSON Table first, and then perform aggregate query on the connected data table. Can be shortened to aggregate directly by JSON Array field.

Data table `service` :

| id  | city     | kind          | industries(JSON Array)          | pricing(JSON Array\<Object\>)                                               | amount |
| --- | -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1   | Beijing  | Cloud Hosting | `["Education","Medical"]`       | `[{"id":1, "name":"Monthly Payment"},{"id":2, "name" :"Pay annually"}]`     | 50     |
| 2   | Beijing  | Cloud Hosting | `["Art","Medical"]`             | `[{"id":1, "name":"Monthly Payment"},{"id":3, "name" :"one-time payment"}]` | 50     |
| 3   | Beijing  | Cloud Storage | `["Education","Manufacturing"]` | `[{"id":2, "name":"Annual Payment"},{"id":3, "name" :"one-time payment"}]`  | 50     |
| 4   | Shanghai | Cloud Hosting | `["Energy","Car"]`              | `[{"id":1, "name":"Monthly Pay"}]`                                          | 200    |

Query DSL:

```json
{
  "select": [
    "@industries as industries",
    "@pricing[*].name as billing method",
    ":SUM(amount) as amount"
  ],
  "from": "service",
  "groups": [
    { "field": "industry", "rollup": "all industries" },
    { "field": "Billing method", "rollup": "All billing methods" }
  ]
}
```

The parsed `SQL statement` (MySQL8):

```sql
SELECT
  IF(GROUPING(`Industry`), 'All industries', `Industry`) AS `Industry`,
  IF(GROUPING(`Billing method`), 'All billing methods', `Billing method`) AS `Billing method`,
  SUM(`amount`) AS `amount`
FROM `service`
  JOIN JSON_TABLE(`service`.`industries`, '$[*]' columns (`industries` varchar(50) path '$') ) as industries
  JOIN JSON_TABLE(`service`.`pricing`, '$[*]' columns (`billing method` varchar(50) path '$.name') ) as pricing
GROUP by `Industry`, `Billing method` WITH ROLLUP
```

Return result:

| Industry       | Billing Method      | Quantity |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| Manufacturing  | One Time Fee        | 50       |
| Manufacturing  | Paid annually       | 50       |
| Manufacturing  | All Billing Methods | 100      |
| Medical        | One-time fee        | 50       |
| Medical        | Paid annually       | 50       |
| Medical        | Pay per month       | 100      |
| Medical        | All Billing Methods | 200      |
| Education      | One Time Fee        | 50       |
| Education      | Paid annually       | 100      |
| Education      | Paid Monthly        | 50       |
| Education      | All Billing Methods | 200      |
| Car            | Pay per month       | 200      |
| Car            | All billing methods | 200      |
| Energy         | Pay per month       | 200      |
| Energy         | All Billing Methods | 200      |
| Art            | One Time Fee        | 50       |
| Art            | Paid Monthly        | 50       |
| Art            | All Billing Methods | 100      |
| All Industries | All Billing Methods | 1000     |
