## installation steps

### Step 1: Install Yao

Method 1: Run the installation script

```bash
curl -fsSL https://website.yaoapps.com/install.sh | bash
```

Method 2: Manually download the product

Download the product whose Linux architecture is amd64 and copy it to the bin directory. [Download address](https://yaoapps.com/release)

```bash
cp yao-0.10.1-linux-amd64 /usr/bin/yao
chmod +x /usr/bin/yao
yao version
```

Method 3: Source code compilation

Refer to the [source code compilation](../Expert/Source%20Code%20Compilation) document to compile the product. Copy the artifact to the /usr/bin/ directory and add executable permissions.

### Step 2: Add User

Add user

```bash
useradd yao
```

Create application folder

```bash
mkdir /yaoapps
```

### Step 3: Deploy the code

Copy the app code to the app directory, e.g.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YaoApp/demo-crm.git /yaoapps/demo-crm
```

<Notice type="warning">
  Note: In a production environment, set the launch mode to{" "}
  <strong>production</strong>
  Disable the migrate command in production mode to prevent changes to the data table
  structure due to misoperation
</Notice>

### Step 4: Configure the service

Use `pm2` , `supervisor` and other service process management tools.

Supervisor configuration example:

```bash
[program:demo-crm-server]
directory=/yaoapps/demo-crm
command=/usr/local/bin/yao start
process_name=demo-crm-server
numprocs=1
autostart=true
autorestart=true
user=yao
group=yao
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/yaoapps/demo-crm/supervisor.log

```

<Notice type="warning">Note: Do not use root user to start services. </Notice>

Start the service:

```bash
supervisor start
```

Check service status:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:<Port>/api/xiang/ping
```

## proxy server

If you need to use HTTPS or if you have multiple applications installed on one machine, you can use a proxy server such as `Nginx`, `traefik`.

`traefik` configuration example

```bash
[[tls.certificates]]
  certFile = "/data/certs/star.yaoapps.com.crt"
  keyFile = "/data/certs/star.yaoapps.com.key"

[http.routers.demo-crm]
  tls=true
  rule = "Host(`demo-crm.yaoapps.com`)"
  service = "demo-crm@file"

[http.services]
  [http.services.demo-crm.loadBalancer]
    [[http.services.demo-crm.loadBalancer.servers]]
      url = "http://127.0.0.1:<port>/"

```
