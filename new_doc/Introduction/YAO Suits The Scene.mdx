# suitable for the scene

YAO can be used instead of scripting languages ​​in most scenarios, and is used in business systems (ERP, CRM, WMS...), IoT edge computing, back-end API interfaces, application management backgrounds, and self-built low-code platforms. have a greater advantage.

## business system

YAO has built-in [XGEN interface engine](https://github.com/YaoApp/xgen), and can also support independent custom development, design and produce a set of interface component library that conforms to its own design specifications.

Using YAO Widget, you can develop various common function modules faster.

The powerful expansion capability of YAO Widget can better support special business logic and truly tailor-made.

## IoT Edge Computing

YAO supports running on Arm64 devices. It can be used in various scenarios of IoT edge computing to improve the coding efficiency of IoT edge computing applications.

## Admin background

The built-in XGEN interface can meet the functions required by most applications in the background.

Through YAO Widget, you can even connect to the database and immediately generate an application management background application. (Related tutorials will be given later)

## API interface

YAO provides a large number of conventional processors, which can cover almost 80% of the application scenarios. To write an API with YAO, you only need to associate the handler with the API interface description.

## Low code platform

Most general-purpose low-code platforms have to sacrifice personalized business logic or usage logic in order to have better versatility.

For most platforms like code generators, the generated code is mostly one-time code, or the programming tool adjustment provided is to be locked, providing uncertain risks for the maintainability of the project.

YAO DSL can be manually written, contextual logic generation, visual interface generation, DSL generated by program or interface, engineers can take over maintenance at any time, iteratively updated, and easier to maintain.

Based on the extension capability of YAO Widget, it can encapsulate its own business logic and build a code platform that fully conforms to its own business characteristics.

## Other scenes

Using the `yao run` command, you can run any processor, and Task and Schedule Widget can also implement concurrent tasks and scheduled tasks more conveniently.

It is more convenient to use YAO to build various backends to run scripts.
